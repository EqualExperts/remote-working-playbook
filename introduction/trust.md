# Trust

> _**Hanlon’s Razor**_ _- Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by misunderstanding or neglect._

Trust is a multiplier! Teams need to collaborate to deliver a goal, and if basic levels of trust are not present, it leads to fewer interactions and, therefore, even less trust. If you want to build trust in a team, communication is key. With communication, you learn about the personality of your teammates. You can assess their values \(and how they fit with yours\) and evaluate their capability and expertise.

**Impact on Remote Working:** Open, prompt and continued interactions allow you to gather evidence about other members’ credibility and trustworthiness. Take the extra effort and time to talk via video and keep constant communication via Slack. If you’ve gone through the whole day and have only spoken to your cat, then maybe you need to communicate with your team a bit more.
