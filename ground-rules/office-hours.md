# Office Hours

Be respectful of different time zones and try to schedule calls that are inside of everyone’s working hours when possible. Use tools like [https://everytimezone.com/](https://everytimezone.com/) to find a convenient time for everyone, and enable Secondary Time Zone in Google Calendar settings to see other regions’ times from within your calendar.

Publicise what the team’s collectively overlapping core hours are. Don’t forget about daylight savings and different public holidays and working weeks.

Maintain core hours for your time zone, so at least people will know when they can expect you to be available.

Expecting people to shift their working hours is possible, but will often lead to disappointment. People have lives outside of work, you know, and important things like friends and family can be hard to rearrange. However, if you can nudge your day, then have a go, as increasing the overlap of timezones adds to productivity. Just don’t expect it to happen.
