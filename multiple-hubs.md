# Multiple Hubs

## Multiple Hubs

Where running multiple hubs in different locations for the same project or product, to make the delivery more effective, consider setting up the organisation like so:

* **Build cross-functional teams** - **Locate a cross-functional team at each hub.** There may be some limitations, e.g., where a role only requires a single individual, the location of the product owner or there isn’t a critical mass of people.  However, creating fully formed teams at each hub and covering roles in areas such as Delivery Leadership, QA, BA, Dev and DevOps will provide better delivery outcomes.
* **Ensure Regular Rotation** - Regular rotation between each hub will allow people to form real relationships. Ideally, rotate the location and bring more than just the delivery lead/tech lead to get full rotation around the different locations.
* **Kick-off new work together** - For new work coming into the team run an inception that is co-located, cross-functional and made up of members from across the different hubs.
* **Share purpose -** Those in roles such as product owner and sponsor should travel to different locations and share purpose with everyone on the team. Ideally, this should be done quarterly.

## Fully Distributed

While video conferencing has improved substantially, it still doesn’t build team bonds like meeting face to face does. If teams are virtual, then arrange to meet up from time to time. Try to make it every quarter.
